## Welcome!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

My name is Major Hayden and I've been an [amateur radio operator] in the United
States since 2017. I really enjoy meeting new people on the radio and tinkering
with my equipment to extend my reach.

My interest in amateur radio started when I attended the [Overland Expo] in 2018
and listened to two hams talk about how radio communication helped them have fun
but also allowed them to help with safety for public events. I've [written a long
FAQ] on [my blog] about my experiences so far.

## Equipment

My mobile radio is a Kenwood TM-D710GA with Comet 2m/70cm antennas. At home, I
have an ICOM IC-746 *(heavy, but great)* and an ICOM IC-7300. My home antennas
include a 6m dipole, 20m end fed half wave (EFHW), and a Buddipole that covers
2m to 80m.
